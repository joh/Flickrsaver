               A screensaver for Flickr enthusiasts


    ~ What is it?
    
      Flickrsaver displays photos from Flickr as a screensaver.
      
      It is built on Python and Clutter, and designed for Linux-based
      systems.
    
    ~ What do I need?
      
      Python 2.6+, PyClutter 1.0.2+ and Python-flickrapi.
      
    ~ How does it work?
      
      Flickrsaver downloads and keeps a pool of photos in ~/.cache/flickrsaver/
      Photos are shown at random, and the pool is updated with a new photo
      every time one is shown.
